### Hi! I'm Mattia

I teach **coding for the web** and other **digital stuff**. I always try to use innovative and participatory ways to teach and share my passion for the web. In doing so, I promote **accessibility**, **inclusive design** and an **human-centered web** and I raise awareness of **digital ethics**. The thing I like most about the web is when it manages to create digital cultural and artistic experiences that make a difference and that can be enjoyed by everyone. I love **tabletop RPGs**, especially the more creative ones and I would always like to include them in my activities.  

My last courses and workshops (Italian):
+ [Git and github](https://github.com/lichfolky/corso-git-2023)
+ [Elementi di javascript](https://github.com/lichfolky/elementi-js-2022)

Here you'll find a lot of my strange projects, but most of my experiments are on [codepen](https://codepen.io/lichfolky) or in my [messy glitch page](https://glitch.com/@lichfolky).

My [portfolio](http://lichfolky.github.io) will always be under construction.
