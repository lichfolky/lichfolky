### Hi! I'm Mattia, an italian web designer and developer.

Most of my experiments are on my [messy glitch page](https://glitch.com/@lichfolky) and my exercises are on [codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/pgyJoe).  
Here I store my [unreilable notes](https://github.com/lichfolky/grimoire) and my projects.  
In my [github page]( https://lichfolky.github.io/) I'm trying to document what I'm currently experimenting on.  
My [portfolio]( https://lichfolky.com/) is still under construction.  


I'm not responsable for any use of anything I share. 
But feel free to use it in any way.
