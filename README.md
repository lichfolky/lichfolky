### Hi! I'm Mattia, an italian web designer and developer.

Here I store my [unreliable notes](https://github.com/lichfolky/grimoire), some [files](https://gist.github.com/lichfolky) and my projects.  
Most of my experiments are on [codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/pgyJoe) or in my [messy glitch page](https://glitch.com/@lichfolky). 

My [portfolio]( https://lichfolky.com/) will always be under construction.  


I'm not responsable for any use of anything I share.  
But feel free to use it in any way.
